# Political Discourse Through Twitter
The Political Discourse Through Twitter (PDTT) project is an analysis on tweets made by members of the United States Congress. It measures communications, trending topics, and sentiments of observed tweets.

PDTT was a capstone project for a course with UC Davis on Coursera. I have updated the assignment since I orginally submitted it utilizing new skills I have learned.

Original case statement:

"Lobbyists4America is a company that seeks to provide insights to their customers (who aim to affect legislation within the US).  They want you to analyze the 2008-2017 congressional tweets in order to understand key topics, members, and relationships within Congress.  These insights will help them focus and strengthen their lobbying efforts."

PDTT was orginally written using SQL with the Databricks Community software. It is currently in the process of being transfered to a version controled repo on GitHub using python and r. The goal of the update is to provide better storage methods, make updates to code easier, and to help scale the project to provide more useful insights.
